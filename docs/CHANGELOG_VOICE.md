# CHANGELOG voice + release-summary format

Every version entry in `CHANGELOG.md` MUST start with a release-summary section in
the GStack/Garry voice — one viewport's worth of prose + tables that lands like a
verdict, not marketing. The itemized changelog (subsections, bullets, files) goes
BELOW that summary, separated by a `### Itemized changes` header.

The release-summary section gets read by humans, by the auto-update agent, and by
anyone deciding whether to upgrade. The itemized list is for agents that need to
know exactly what changed.

## Release-summary template

Use this structure for the top of every `## [X.Y.Z]` entry:

1. **Two-line bold headline** (10-14 words total) ... should land like a verdict, not
   marketing. Sound like someone who shipped today and cares whether it works.
2. **Lead paragraph** (3-5 sentences) ... what shipped, what changed for the user.
   Specific, concrete, no AI vocabulary, no em dashes, no hype.
3. **A "The X numbers that matter" section** with:
   - One short setup paragraph naming the source of the numbers (real production
     deployment OR a reproducible benchmark ... name the file/command to run).
   - A table of 3-6 key metrics with BEFORE / AFTER / Δ columns.
   - A second optional table for per-category breakdown if relevant.
   - 1-2 sentences interpreting the most striking number in concrete user terms.
4. **A "What this means for [audience]" closing paragraph** (2-4 sentences) tying
   the metrics to a real workflow shift. End with what to do.

Voice rules:
- No em dashes (use commas, periods, "...").
- No AI vocabulary (delve, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, fundamental, etc.) or
  banned phrases ("here's the kicker", "the bottom line", etc.).
- Real numbers, real file names, real commands. Not "fast" but "~30s on 30K pages."
- Short paragraphs, mix one-sentence punches with 2-3 sentence runs.
- Connect to user outcomes: "the agent does ~3x less reading" beats "improved
  precision."
- Be direct about quality. "Well-designed" or "this is a mess." No dancing.

Source material to pull from:
- CHANGELOG.md previous entry for prior context
- `docs/benchmarks/[latest].md` for the headline numbers
- Recent commits (`git log <prev-version>..HEAD --oneline`) for what shipped
- Don't make up numbers. If a metric isn't in a benchmark or production data, don't
  include it. Say "no measurement yet" if asked.

Target length: ~250-350 words for the summary. Should render as one viewport.

## "To take advantage of v[version]" block (required, v0.13+)

After the release-summary and BEFORE `### Itemized changes`, every `## [X.Y.Z]`
entry MUST include a human-readable self-repair block under the heading
`## To take advantage of v[version]`.

Why: `gbrain upgrade` runs `gbrain post-upgrade` which runs `gbrain apply-migrations`.
This chain has a known weak link — `upgrade.ts` catches post-upgrade failures as
best-effort (so the binary still works). When that chain silently fails, users end
up with half-upgraded brains. The self-repair block gives them a paste-ready
recovery path; the v0.13+ `~/.gbrain/upgrade-errors.jsonl` trail + `gbrain doctor`
integration close the loop.

Template (adapt the verify commands per release):

```markdown
## To take advantage of v[version]

`gbrain upgrade` should do this automatically. If it didn't, or if `gbrain doctor`
warns about a partial migration:

1. **Run the orchestrator manually:**
   ```bash
   gbrain apply-migrations --yes
   ```
2. **Your agent reads `skills/migrations/v[version].md` the next time you interact with it.**
   [One sentence on whether headless agents need manual action, or whether the
   orchestrator already handled the mechanical side.]
3. **Verify the outcome:**
   ```bash
   [release-specific verify commands, e.g. `gbrain graph ... --depth 2`]
   gbrain stats
   ```
4. **If any step fails or the numbers look wrong,** please file an issue:
   https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/issues with:
   - output of `gbrain doctor`
   - contents of `~/.gbrain/upgrade-errors.jsonl` if it exists
   - which step broke

   This feedback loop is how the gbrain maintainers find fragile upgrade paths. Thank you.
```

**Skip this block** for patches that are pure bug fixes with zero user-facing action
(rare). If the release has a schema migration, data backfill, or new feature the
user needs to verify, the block is required.

The v0.13.0 entry in CHANGELOG.md is the canonical example.

## Itemized changes

Below the release summary, write `### Itemized changes` and continue with the
detailed subsections (Knowledge Graph Layer, Schema migrations, Security hardening,
Tests, etc.). Same rules as before:

- Lead with what the user can now DO that they couldn't before
- Frame as benefits and capabilities, not files changed or code written
- Make the user think "hell yeah, I want that"
- Bad: "Added GBRAIN_VERIFY.md installation verification runbook"
- Good: "Your agent now verifies the entire GBrain installation end-to-end, catching
  silent sync failures and stale embeddings before they bite you"
- Bad: "Setup skill Phase H and Phase I added"
- Good: "New installs automatically set up live sync so your brain never falls behind"
- **Always credit community contributions.** When a CHANGELOG entry includes work from
  a community PR, name the contributor with `Contributed by @username`. Contributors
  did real work. Thank them publicly every time, no exceptions.

## Reference: v0.12.0 entry as canonical example

The v0.12.0 entry in CHANGELOG.md is the canonical example of the format. Match its
structure for every future version: bold headline, lead paragraph, "numbers that
matter" with BrainBench-style before/after table, "what this means" closer, then
`### Itemized changes` with the detailed sections below.
